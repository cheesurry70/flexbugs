### Important! Please read before opening an issue:

- This repo **is not** for reporting Flexbox bugs in browsers. Please report those directly to the browsers themselves. Here's a link to all major browser bug trackers: https://developers.google.com/web/feedback/#reporting-bugs

- This repo **is** for reporting cross-browser workarounds to already-reported Flexbox bugs. Please do not open an issue unless you know of a good workaround and the bug has already been reported to all affected browsers.

### Things to include in your issue:

- Please include links to the bugs for each affected browser's bug tracker.

- Please include a live demo (CodePen or JSBin) showing both the issue and the workaround.

- Please clearly explain exactly what the expected behavior is and what's not happening in the affected browser(s). It's not always immediately obvious from looking at a demo what is wrong.
